# openSM
openSM is a new project of mine in which I aim to make an open source social media platform written in C. I aim to make it so that you can upload files,direct message someone, write to your story and much much more. As of now the things that I have done are as follows:
Client and server can communicate well.
Client and server can authenticate
You can post to your wall(very buggy)
You can read others walls(Very buggy)
Some I/O Functions implemented that will help in the future
